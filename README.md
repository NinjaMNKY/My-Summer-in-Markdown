# My-Summer-in-Markdown
## Introduction 
Hello, my name is Raymond Ramos and I am in tenth grade. 
## Favorite Movie 
Over the summer my favorite movies that I watched were the Lord of the Rings movies. All three of these movies tell one of the best stories ever told, as well as being the best action adventure movies there has ever been. My favorite from the trilogy was Return of the King. The ending was also well worth the 9 hours I watched.
## Summer travel Experiences
Over the summer I went to Jamacia and Orlando Florida. In Jamacia I went to the beach and went ziplining aswell as atv riding. In Orlando Florida I went to DisneyWorld aswell as Universal Studios.
## Expectations for this class
In this class I hope to get to say I know how to code. Since we will be learning Java I hope I can use these skills later down even if I'm not taking a computer science class.
## Most Memerorable Experience
Over the summer my most memerable experience was when I went to Disney World. I went to Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and Epcot. Between the rides, food, and atmostphere I enjoyed everyday I was in those parks. I can't say one specific part was my favorite since the entire trip was a lot of fun and I hope I can go back one day.
